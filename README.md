1. This is a random password generator program written in JavaScript
2. Different array methods are used here
3. A function called "shuffle" is defined which will return an array of shuffled alphabets(both in uppercase and lowercase) and digits when called.
4. From that shuffled array we will extract 10 random characters and will create an array of them. Then we will convert that new array to a string which will ultimately be our password.
